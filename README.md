You can save and load the coordinates of the configured objects in JSON format.

> Recommended Usage

Designers provide images of specific objects they have placed on the map or provide a design document with placed images.

Use GPT or an AI API capable of image recognition to obtain relative coordinates in JSON format.

Alternatively, manually calculate the relative coordinates.

Add the calculated coordinates, and while adjusting the offset settings, create and verify if the object placements match the planned layout!
